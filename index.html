    <h1>Visually hidden content and empty links on mobile screen readers</h1>
    <p>Author: Michael Turvey</p>
    <p>Date: 2022-02-18</p>
    <p>
      This is a test case designed to determine how VoiceOver on iOS and
      TalkBack on Android react to different ways of making an accessible anchor
      tag without visible text content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can often occur if a site is using a non-standard glyph, decorative
      image, or some other content to provide visual context for the link, which
      cannot be read by a screen reader.
    </p>
    <p>Anchor tags have been marked up in links to provide a focusable area.</p>

    <h2>Summary of findings</h2>
    <p>
      These tests reveal 2 issues with how mobile screen readers handle visually
      hidden content and empty links.
    </p>

    <h3>TalkBack does not focus links with visually hidden text</h3>
    <p>
      When an anchor tag only contains visually hidden text, TalkBack does not
      focus the link.
    </p>

    <h3>
      VoiceOver treats visually hidden text as a seperate focusable element to
      regular text within an anchor tag.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Visually hidden text is technically still accessible using VoiceOver, but
      it is not in the expected location. A user who attempts to find text at
      the expected location may find regular text which is hidden from the
      screen reader, and be unaware of focusable text positioned adjacent to the
      unfocusable text.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Do not use empty anchor tags. </strong>Empty anchor tags will not be focused by
        TalkBack or VoiceOver.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Avoid anchor tags which only contain visually hidden text.</strong> They will not be focused by TalkBack.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it is necessary to display different content to visual and screen
      reader users, anchor tags can contain aria-hidden visually displayed
      content, and visually hidden text for screen reader users. If possible,
      add a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or some other method to push the visually
      hidden text to a new line. This will place the text in a more intuitive
      location for VoiceOver users.
