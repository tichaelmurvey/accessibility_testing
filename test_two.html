<h1>List tagging and screen reader interactions test</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h2>Test 1: Auto-tagged list</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>List was created using the text tool in Acrobat, then tagged
with the <span class=SpellE>autotag</span> feature in Acrobat.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list body
text, skipping the first item.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>NVDA + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list body
text, skipping the first item.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List content announced as plain text. Text was not
identified as a list, and list shortcuts returned “No next list”.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through bullets
(tagged as label). Arrow key navigation required to access list body.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list
items, focusing bullet and text at the same time. List items are announced as “Bullet
[body text] graphic”.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did not announce list. On L/I shortcuts, announces no lists
or list items.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>List items (including bullet and text) can be focused with
arrow keys and are announced as “Bullet [body text]”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Test 2: Auto-tagged list with manually deleted and replaced list item </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deleted a single list item <span class=GramE>tag, and</span>
recreated the tag structure using “Create tag from content” and “New tag”.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The recreated list item was ignored by NVDA. The list was
announced as 3 items rather than 4.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced as list with 4 items. List navigation and
shortcuts functioned as expected.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Chrome<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List content announced as plain text. Text was not
identified as a list, and list shortcuts returned “No next list”.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 3 items. On “I” moves through first two
bullets, then to the text “Chocolate”, then loops to the top of the list.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list
items, focusing bullet and text at the same time. List items are announced as “Bullet
[body text] graphic”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did not announce list. On L/I shortcuts, announces no lists
or list items.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>List items (including bullet and text) can be focused with
arrow keys and are announced as “Bullet [body text]”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<h2>Test 3: Fully remade list markup</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deleted tag tree and recreated all tags from scratch using new
tag and tag content from selection tools.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List announced including number of items. List navigation
and shortcuts functioned as expected.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List announced including number of items. List navigation
and shortcuts functioned as expected.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>NVDA + Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List content announced as plain text. Text was not
identified as a list, and list shortcuts returned “No next list”.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through bullets
(tagged as label). Arrow key navigation required to access list body.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list
items, focusing bullet and text at the same time. List items are announced as “Bullet
[body text] graphic”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Chrome<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did not announce list. On L/I shortcuts, announces no lists
or list items.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>List items (including bullet and text) can be focused with
arrow keys and are announced as “Bullet [body text]”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<h2>Test 4: Manually replaced one list item in fully remade list tag structure</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using the manually created list markup, deleted a single
list item tag, and recreated the tag structure using “Create tag from content”
and “New tag” tools.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The recreated list item was ignored by NVDA. The list was
announced as 3 items rather than 4.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List announced including number of items. List navigation
and shortcuts functioned as expected.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 3 items. On “I” moves through first two
bullets, then to the text “Chocolate”, then loops to the top of the list.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Firefox<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list
items, focusing bullet and text at the same time. List items are announced as “Bullet
[body text] graphic”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Test 5: Manually replaced full list in existing tag tree</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deleted the functioning list markup, but not the tag tree
itself. Recreated the list structure from scratch using “Create tag from
content” and “New tag” tools.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List was not announced. List content was not accessible by
the screen reader.</p>

<h3>NVDA + Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List announced with 4 items. List navigation and shortcuts
functioned as expected.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>JAWS + Acrobat</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>List was not announced. List content was not accessible by
the screen reader.</p>

<h3>JAWS + Firefox<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Announced list with 4 items. On “I” moves through list
items, focusing bullet and text at the same time. List items are announced as “Bullet
[body text] graphic”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

</span></span></span><![endif]>JAWS does not seem to have a great relationship

</span></span></span><![endif]>In cases where list item tags are deleted and
re-created, Acrobat will not announce those list items to screen readers. This
creates unpredictable behaviour in JAWS and NVDA. I have investigated the
content tree and tag properties for the newly created tag. I cannot find any
differences between the two constructions. Therefore, I’m calling this an Acrobat
bug.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin'><span
style='mso-list:Ignore'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>The bug identified in item 4 does not occur when
the tag tree is deleted, and new tags are created from content.</p>

<h2>Speculation</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “Graphic” announcement of JAWS on Firefox may be
recognising the bullets. This would be consistent with JAWS not recognising label
tags on Acrobat.</p>

<h2>Further testing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most importantly, tests should be done to determine which if
any other elements are affected by the delete + retag bug on Acrobat. I have
tested the same process with a heading element, and the bug was not reproduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tests should be done to determine behaviour when elements
are incorrectly tagged at initial markup, then retagged as list items later. For
example, if an item is initially tagged as a &lt;P&gt; then retagged as a list
item, does the Acrobat bug apply?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Test should be done to determine if the Acrobat bug occurs when
new content is added via the edit tool, then manually tagged. If the explanation
of the results above is correct, this content should be announced as it has not
previously been tagged. However, this has not been tested and the results may
be unexpected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to know how screen readers react to tagging
bullets as artefacts rather than labels. This may improve quality of content
flow on <span class=GramE>JAWS, but</span> may also break the list flow.</p>
