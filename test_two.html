    <h2>Findings</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Lists in PDFs are not supported by Chrome.</li>

      <li>
        Firefox is the only user agent which announced the intended list markup
        across all tests.
      </li>

      <li>
        JAWS does not seem to have a great relationship with the Label element.
        On Acrobat it is assumed to be the link element.
      </li>

      <li>
        In cases where list item tags are deleted and re-created, Acrobat will
        not announce those list items to screen readers. This creates
        unpredictable behaviour in JAWS and NVDA. I have investigated the
        content tree and tag properties for the newly created tag. I cannot find
        any differences between the two constructions. Therefore, I’m calling
        this an Acrobat bug.
      </li>

      <li>
        The bug identified in item 4 does not occur when the tag tree is
        deleted, and new tags are created from content.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Speculation</h2>

    <p>
      The “Graphic” announcement of JAWS on Firefox may be recognising the
      bullets. This would be consistent with JAWS not recognising label tags on
      Acrobat.
    </p>

    <h2>Further testing</h2>

    <p>
      Most importantly, tests should be done to determine which if any other
      elements are affected by the delete + retag bug on Acrobat. I have tested
      the same process with a heading element, and the bug was not reproduced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tests should be done to determine behaviour when elements are incorrectly
      tagged at initial markup, then retagged as list items later. For example,
      if an item is initially tagged as a &lt;P&gt; then retagged as a list
      item, does the Acrobat bug apply?
    </p>

    <p>
      Test should be done to determine if the Acrobat bug occurs when new
      content is added via the edit tool, then manually tagged. If the
      explanation of the results above is correct, this content should be
      announced as it has not previously been tagged. However, this has not been
      tested and the results may be unexpected.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to know how screen readers react to tagging bullets as
      artefacts rather than labels. This may improve quality of content flow on
      JAWS, but may also break the list flow.
